What we still need to do:

When model prototype runs:
- Check run time on Raspberry Pi

To make the prototype work:
- try to optimize the image processing (eg: enhance edges, details, colours, etc.)
- decrease the number of dense / no of parameters
- optimize kernel size
- be carefull with overfitting
