next time:

when model prototype runs:
-check run time on raspberry pi

to make the prototype work:
-try to optimize the image processing (eg: enhance edges, details, colours,etc.)
-decrease the number of dense / no of parameters (vers 3)
-optimize kernel size
-carefull with overfitting

--augment the pictures/data
